# LyricsApp

LyricsApp is a simple Android application that allows users to search for and display song lyrics by entering the song title and artist name. The app fetches lyrics from the [Lyrics.ovh API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/).

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive design with Material Design 3 components.
- **Real-Time Fetching**: Retrieves song lyrics in real-time using Retrofit.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user feedback for invalid input or network errors.
